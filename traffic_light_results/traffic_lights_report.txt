STUDY OVERVIEW:
This study compares vehicle journey times and traffic efficiency
with and without traffic light control in smart highway scenarios.

SCENARIOS COMPARED:
A. Smart Highway WITHOUT Traffic Lights
B. Smart Highway WITH Traffic Lights

DETAILED RESULTS:
------------------------------

NO TRAFFIC LIGHTS:
  Average Journey Time: 15.67 steps
  Average Wait Time: 0.00 steps per vehicle
  Collision Rate: 8.40 collisions per 100 steps
  Completion Rate: 92.92%
  Total Spawned: 113 vehicles
  Total Completed: 105 vehicles

WITH TRAFFIC LIGHTS:
  Average Journey Time: 36.34 steps
  Average Wait Time: 18.25 steps per vehicle
  Collision Rate: 105.60 collisions per 100 steps
  Completion Rate: 83.84%
  Total Spawned: 99 vehicles
  Total Completed: 83 vehicles

COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS:
------------------------------
Journey Time Impact: +20.67 steps (+131.9%)
Wait Time Added: 18.25 steps per vehicle
Safety Improvement: -97.20 fewer collisions per 100 steps
Completion Rate Change: -9.08%

KEY FINDINGS:
--------------------
• Traffic lights increase journey time but may improve safety
• Traffic light timing optimization can balance efficiency and safety
• Queue management is critical for traffic light effectiveness
