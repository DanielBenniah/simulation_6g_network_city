STUDY OVERVIEW:
This study compares two competing traffic management paradigms:
1. Traditional Traffic Lights (vehicles wait at red lights)
2. 6G Smart Communication (vehicles coordinate in real-time)

PARADIGMS COMPARED:
A. Traffic Lights: Fixed timing, vehicles queue and wait
B. 6G Smart: Dynamic coordination, no fixed infrastructure

DETAILED RESULTS:
----------------------------------------

TRAFFIC LIGHTS PARADIGM:
  Average Journey Time: 64.80 steps
  Average Wait Time: 96.52 steps per vehicle
  Collision Rate: 2500.40 per 100 steps
  Completion Rate: 23.81%
  Traffic Efficiency: 50.5%
  Total Spawned: 21 vehicles
  Total Completed: 5 vehicles

6G SMART PARADIGM:
  Average Journey Time: 16.30 steps
  Average Wait Time: 0.00 steps per vehicle
  Collision Rate: 21.20 per 100 steps
  Completion Rate: 94.50%
  Traffic Efficiency: 100.0%
  Total Spawned: 109 vehicles
  Total Completed: 103 vehicles

COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS:
------------------------------
Journey Time Difference: +48.50 steps (6G is 74.8% faster)
Wait Time Eliminated: 96.52 steps per vehicle (6G advantage)
Safety Improvement: +2479.20 collision rate difference
Efficiency Improvement: +49.5% (6G advantage)

KEY FINDINGS:
--------------------
• 6G paradigm eliminates waiting time entirely
• Real-time coordination vs fixed scheduling trade-offs
• Infrastructure cost differences (lights vs communication)
• Scalability and adaptability considerations
